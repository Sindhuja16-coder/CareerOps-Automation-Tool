🔧 HOW TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR JOB SEARCH
============================================================

Everyone wants different jobs! Here is how to set yours:

1. Right-click 'job_alerts.py' and select "Edit".
2. Scroll to the "USER SETTINGS" section at the top.

3. TO CHANGE LOCATION:
   Find: TARGET_CITY = "Hyderabad"
   Change it to: TARGET_CITY = "Bangalore" (or any city you want)

4. TO CHANGE ROLES:
   Find: TARGET_ROLES = ["Data Analyst", "Data Engineer"]
   
   You can add or remove roles inside the brackets.
   Example for a Java Developer:
   TARGET_ROLES = ["Java Developer", "Spring Boot", "Software Engineer"]

   *IMPORTANT rules for editing:*
   - Keep the text inside "quotes".
   - Separate multiple roles with a comma.
   - Do not remove the square brackets [ ].

5. Save the file and run 'Start_CareerOps.bat' again!
